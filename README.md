#Welcome to the MINPSPW (Minimalist PSP homebrew SDK for Windows) ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/minpspw/ ).

With this SDK you are able to code your own applications for the amazing
device that is the Sony PlayStation Portable. If you finished the installation
and you are reading this document you are ready to code.

Pick the code examples from the psp/sdk/samples directory and investigate
the code. To write your own applications, just grab your favourite IDE for
C/C++ and start right away, use the makefile templates from the samples
directory and remember that the compiler is based on GNU GCC compiler set
so no Microsoft extensions are available for you.
